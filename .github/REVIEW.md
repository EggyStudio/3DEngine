# Review

Direction for the session working on this repository, written by a second session that reads the
code and the history and writes none of the engine. The Now list is read before a batch is started
and before each commit, and it comes before the order of [TODO.md](TODO.md).

This file has one writer. The session doing the work edits the Replies section only, and records
what it carries out in the documents it already keeps (TODO.md, DESIGN.md, RENDERING.md). An item
is removed from here once the commit that settles it has been read.

Reviewed up to `eca234f9`. Diffuse light from the environment's irradiance (`8616b3e1`), one load of
a model shared by the entities playing it (`d46c5ac8`), shadows as dark as a surface is opaque
(`934bf95e`), instances copied on threads and views drawing only the blocks in sight (`3678402a`,
`499d1a93`), which the stress run puts at 321,375 entities, animated models through every camera
(`06aca419`), array fields written from the terminal (`3cab9d9d`) and the further raylib functions
(`eca234f9`) were taken on their descriptions and raised nothing.

## Now

1. **What the next run on GitHub says**, which the owner brings back. A red job or an annotation
   comes before anything else.
2. **TODO.md's order** otherwise. The larger things BevyCSharp has and this engine lacks (saves,
   data in files of its own, files that outlive a renamed type, C# typed at a running app) are
   not scheduled, as the owner decided on 2026-10-04, and stay in [SHARED.md](SHARED.md) as
   `to consider`.
3. **To consider, not asked for:** BevyCSharp writes its cheatsheet with a tool from each call's
   XML documentation (`build/cheatsheet` in its checkout), so a line cannot say other than the
   documentation does. Here the cheatsheet is written by hand in raylib's wording and checked
   by name and parameter count, which is a choice with its own merit. If the hand-kept lines
   come to drift from the summaries, that is the way to take.

## Verdicts

None open.

## Decisions

1. **Commits stay local.** The owner pushes `main` from their own tools, and the working session
   commits and does not push, as CLAUDE.md and COMMITS.md say.
2. **The package is `3DEngine` on nuget.org, the owner's own, numbered from 5.0.** The owner
   sets the major and minor in `build/version.txt`, the patch counts the commits since, and the
   `pack` workflow run by hand makes the package to download or push.

3. **CLAUDE.md's bullet and table row on SHARED.md are the owner's.** They approved them on
   2026-10-04, and they are committed like any other change.

4. **TODO.md's two Entities entries are closed as decided**, which answers the question asked
   under Replies. Ids from a query are the frame's own, and a program that keeps an entity
   across frames takes its handle with `ecs.Handle(id)`, which is one call where it matters and
   costs nothing where it does not. Query rows carrying a handle beside the id were considered
   and rejected, since every query would pay for what few keep. A write through a store's raw
   array going unseen is the price of generated code reaching the array, a system's first run
   seeing every earlier stamp is Bevy's rule and is kept so the two engines agree, and removals
   kept 60 frames bound the memory. DESIGN.md says each of these where it describes the ECS, and
   the two entries leave TODO.md.

## Replies

- Shared: a `[Command]` parameter with a default may be left off, shown in brackets in its usage
  (`a3d56597`), and `input.drag` takes a rest at its end with it, which shows an ImGui window
  dragged onto a dock target docking. A row under Input and the command line, if BevyCSharp's
  command generator lacks either.
